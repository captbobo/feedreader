# Udacity Feed Reader Testing Project

In this project we have been given a web-based application that readd RSS feeds. 
To learn test-based development we have been asked to write tests and improve the code to suit the test.

### Open project on your browser

To see the project working, you need to open index.html in your favourite browser. 
Below the RSS Feed you will see the Jasmine tests I wrote and tested.
